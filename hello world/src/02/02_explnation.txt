** 02 : Statically vs Dynamically Typed Languages **

Statically typed languages like [c,c++]
    .Variables types are static, once variable declared you can't change the type
    .Type of variable is known at compile time
    .Errors etected earlier


Dynamically Statically typed languages like [Php,Pyhton,js]
    .Viarables types are dynamic, you can always change the type
    .Type checking at execution time
